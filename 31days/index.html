Prologue
</p>
<p>
Time: something which can be anything depending on your perception. It 
could be everything or nothing. It could be slow or fast. It could merely be a 
symbol or a measurement with which we record our lives or even a physical 
phenomenon existing in the fourth dimension.
</p>
<p>
As a measurement,<br>
Each decade has 10 years.<br>
Each year has 365 1/4 days.<br>
Those 365 1/4 days are distributed among 12 months.<br>
Each month has 30 to 31 days except February which has either 28 or 29 days.<br>
December has 31 days.<br>
31 days have 744 hours.<br>
744 hours have 44640 minutes.<br>
44640 minutes have 2678400 seconds.<br>
</p>
<p>
By changing the units it looks as though it is a lot. It is. A month is a lot. It is 
only 1/207 of the other months I have lived through. It is as though it is 
insignificant.
</p>
<p>
Why December?<br>
Because it is a period of transformation. For me. For everyone. December is 
always the month of transformation. It is the end of the year, the last month 
of the twelve.
</p>
<p>
Why December 2007?<br>
It is between the end of a life I got used to and the beginning of a new one. 
Transformation is partially the theme of this book. And like all things, we too 
change and transform.

<p>This is the first entry. The beginning as they call it. Everything has to start from somewhere. For me, I start on the first day in December. Today breezed through like the gentle evening winds.</p><p>I do love beginnings. Most of the time it starts slowly, much like this one. No matter how small it is, everything starts from something. And from that little speck of white, it will snowball into an avalanche.</p><p>I opened the door and went outside to taste the fresh air. I let my mind wander about. I felt as though I was high, as though the whole world was being seen in a different view. With all the colourful lights around me, it lit up a spark.</p><p>I opened the door and that was my beginning.</p>

<p>In a blink of an eye, the second day is here. And that one blink takes around eight hours for me. It was truly a blink as my dreams and nightmares were not present.</p><p>A blink of an eye is all it takes to clarify something. At first sight, the world can be a blur. The eyes cannot interpret in the first glimpse. It takes some time to absorb it. Most of the time, we underestimate the complexity of a certain thing.</p><p>Until we realise it. Or it is pointed out. Only until we stare long enough at that one thing for an obscenely long time and take a brief moment to ponder upon it we will be able to understand.</p><p>Ignorance is bliss. Knowledge is power.

<p>I peek from the corner of my eye and notice a strange sensation. A strong feeling tells me that this is a different day. It tells me that where I am is not somewhere I often go but I have been here before.</p><p>I see colourful lights, tables, chairs, people, decorations, screens and food.<br>I smell food, perfume, cologne and the cold air of a conditioned area.<br>I taste food of different combinations of sour, sweet, salty and bitter.<br>I hear conversations, music, clinks, shuffling, voices and footsteps.<br>I feel the coldness, cloth, glass, water, skin and metal.</p><p>We rely on these sense to navigate our existence. Apart from all the good, it can also do the same for the bad. Ironically it is good that our sense pick up the bad. If not, we would never know.</p>

<p>The future; a place of tomorrow, where people see possibilities to look forward to. A place where dreams become reality for the optimistic ones. The future, the near-synonym of hope as most choose to believe.</p><p>These were words of which I typed while I switched between screens on the computer. It does not belong to me however; I have rented this computer for the time being in order to entertain myself with graphics which are ours to control. I am not alone though, I am out with a group of nine as we fictionally shoot each other on the screens using nothing but a mouse and a keyboard.</p><p>At the same time, I could be sending messages to people, reading the news, ordering food and so much more.

<p>It grows inside, that strong sensation I try to fight. It enhances my senses in certain unexplainable ways. I can feel my heart pounding against my chest. My head spinning from the air I breathe. My eyelids droop above my eyes. I am an insomniac, tired yet not sleepy. Blood is pumping quickly through my veins. Lights, I see them clearly from the screen as they glare into my eyes. I can feel my heart pacing inside my head. I can feel my eyes going moist from the light. I feel like I am about to faint on top of my keyboard.

<p>The hospital is not a scary place at all.

<p>I stood in line. The line was long. I had been waiting for a while now. The line inched closer and soon there were just two more people away from my turn. Then I saw a familiar face pass by. There was a decision to be made. I decided to wait and get the job done before rushing off. I ran towards the direction of where she went. This place was where we met once more two years ago. I dashed as fast as I could. I managed to spot her. She walked into the crowd. I followed after her. I looked around in the midst of many people. Where had she gone?

<p>I wandered around in the billiard room, examining the craftsmanship of the billiard table when all of a sudden the door barged open. “Professor, Professor, Dr. Boddy is dead,” cried the servant, Mrs White. We all gathered in the middle of the second floor where Dr. Boddy’s body was found. Everyone at the party gathered around. There were six of us, Colonel Mustard, Miss Scarlett, Mr Green, Mrs Peacock, Mrs White and finally I, Professor Plum. We were all separated to various locations to find for clues. I started with the outside of the conservatory. We all had different ideas about who could not have done it, where it could not have been done and what weapon it could not have been.</p><p>Thirty minutes through and we gave a few suggestions, which were argued against. We crossed out various locations, weapons and people and finally it narrowed down. As I approached the study, Miss Scarlett came in my way. She was looking very suspicious. In the end, she made her way and I entered the study to clarify something. My thoughts were accurate. I faced the floor and accused Mr Green who had used a candlestick to kill Dr. Boddy in the Ballroom. All the proof pointed to him and he was arrested. Our game of Cluedo ended.</p>

<p>I never like making decisions at the last minute. I prefer to analyse and predict the upcoming events before making one. However I have made some on-the-spot decisions lately and it has been turning out pretty good.</p><p>However, the effect now can differ from the bigger picture. The future holds the outcome of our lives. My decision right now is to write this in a state of sleepiness which is unbearable to withstand. I think what I am writing might be nonsense.

<p>I woke up in agonising pain. Last night was a blur... The first thing I did when I thought I had amnesia was remember my name. My name was clear to me. Wait... I remembered something. I could smell alcohol. Senses triggered memories and they did well. Ouch. Something was throbbing in my head, pounding hard on my cranium. My eyes opened and I found myself staring into a dustbin filled with wrappers and cans. The stench was horrible. My stomach felt bloated. I checked the time. It was only two in the morning.</p><p>That was my morning. My afternoon was not so great either as I was practically awake the whole morning. So I took a nap after consuming some charcoal pills. It is night now and I am feeling much better. I had fun though before the aches.</p>

<p>The Eclipse (25/12/2007)</p><p>The sun, she dances behind the full moon,<br>In the early of the afternoon,<br>As the shadow blankets the whole ball,<br>Creating an imaginary wall.</p><p>The moon, she gains all the attention.<br>While the people scream out for protection,<br>As though both orbs have joined as one.<br>As the moon has stolen the sun.</p><p>The day, she turns to night without light.<br>Curiosity takes a look at the sight,<br>Dark circle bound by a bright ring,<br>And no one has seen such a thing.</p><p>The people, they run around in panic,<br>The word of doom spreads like toxic,<br>Within the crowd, causing chaos to blend,<br>As they yell about the upcoming end.</p><p>The time, it passes by all this while,<br>Though there is nothing on the dial,<br>After minutes, the sun will emerge,<br>The people were never on the verge.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you existed during the very first eclipse, how would you feel? You notice the sky turning dark and it is not because of clouds but rather an object circulating around the world. Slowly, it begins to grow darker. Torches are lit and people huddled together. The shaman is out, chanting a prayer. You begin to wonder what is this strange phenomenon happening and what will happen. A few minutes pass and it is total darkness in the sky. The sundial has stopped. Everyone is panicking. And after about eight minutes, the sun comes back.</p><p>I wonder how the first Christmas was and how people slowly accepted it. I bet not all of them accepted it the first time. Well, now Christmas is totally different from before, I bet. Either way, Merry Christmas.</p>

<p>Some say randomness is a psychological disorder. I just say it is simply imagination’s way of telling you to stop keeping him inside and let him run wild. It is the ability to say one word, linking it to a word which is linked to another word and it goes on until a word which has no direct meaning is formed. The order in chaos.</p><p>If I were to say pool, I could say computer. That is because pool is like billiards and it has an eight ball which shows you an outlook which is also a program for the computer. I do wonder if it is possible to find something not linked. I guess not though. Bananas contain lots of potassium.</p>

<p>I sit down, just thinking about all the secrets of the world. Curiosity draws me in again as well as certain inspirations. I begin to ponder about certain issues. Probably even start thinking about the meaning of life… Nope, that is just not me. I just think a lot about outcomes and try to figure out people. People are intriguing and contradictory. They try to be different; everyone tries to be different, and would that not make them the same? I guess I am simply curious.</p><p>Curiosity did not kill the cat. I did.</p>

<p>Sadness tells you something is bothering you. John is gone and I should not feel sad. He was the one who fell into a fairy tale of love. And yet, I do hold on to the hope that John will come back. He was a good friend. And yet I am curious to find out what will happen in my life without him.</p><p>We hold on to the hope that we will never be lonely. We are creatures that require social connectivity. When left alone for a long period of time, an outburst of insanity can occur due to an eruption of boredom. We hope to never become insane.</p><p>If you hold on too long, your hands might hurt. But what choice do we have?</p><p>Postscript: Antisocial does not mean incapable of socialising.

<p>Ever written poetry? It is a beautiful art. The flow of your pencil in between the lines upon a paper. The wave of inspiration materializing in ink. </p><p>They say all art has a meaning hidden within. Probably but not necessarily because of the time, it is staring at you, right under your nose. They say you can tell a person by his poetry. I disagree. Poetry does not have to be personal.</p><p>They say a lot of things. I say as the time passes on, my poems mature with me and there are fresh ideas around. Though, I have to remember the first. The starting is the most important.</p>

<p>The only secret a poet has to hide is the meaning of his poems. If you choose to view the poem through your own perception, then it is your choice. A poem can be seen from all angles, some of which a poet does not know. But the only thing a poet wishes is for you to keep an open mind and see in at least two points of view. Only with two points are you able to read between the fine lines. Four points and you make a square. Eight points and you can think outside the box.</p>

And unlike most conclusions, this one is rather refreshing.</p><p>Things are coming to a full circle. Ironically, the ending is about the beginning.

Epilogue
</p>
<p>
This is the end of the book.<br>
If it were a diary, it is my last day of living.<br>
If it were an adventure, the hero has fallen to save the day.<br>
If it were a mystery, the case has been solved.<br>
If it were a calendar, this is the end of the month.
</p>
<p>
And it is.<br>
The moon has completed an orbit around the Earth.<br>
The Earth has completed an orbit around the Sun.
</p>
<p>
But enough of repetition. In the end, it call comes down to the closing; the hardest part. At the 
same time, it is such a relief to finish going through all that.
</p>
<p>
2678400 seconds have passed.<br>
The transformation is complete. However, whether it is successful or not, it has just begun.
</p>
<p>
For John, he was never gone. He is just dormant, at the moment, coming back when he wants to. 
He can never leave. He is me after all. My persona.
</p>
<p>
And for you. It is time for you to walk out that door. You have to leave. But you have to remember. 
Recall the times. Memorise the lines. Remember the past of which you have gone through. Do not forget. 
Everything that has happened is important.
</p>
<p>
For me, my past is preserved within this book. Within each poem, there is a soul of the history. 
And it lives on with me even though thirty-one days are over.
